Welcome to my statistics corner.

This repository contains links to my data science projects done in **R , Python & Stata**.It has short micro projects on statistical techniques in R,my personal Machine Learning projects in R , python, STATA and datahack competition projects.

The projects featured here are done out of my love for statistical thinking and curosity.
